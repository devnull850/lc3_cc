# LC3 C Compiler

This project was inspired by the work of [Justin Meiners](https://github.com/justinmeiners/lc3-vm)' tutorial on a [LC3 VM](https://justinmeiners.github.io/lc3-vm/). I followed his tutorial and it is a fantastic read and code tutorial. I want to get a start in compiler design and implementation. I have a LC3 VM. I just need a LC3 C Compiler to run code in it. Sounds like I found my start.
